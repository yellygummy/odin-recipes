    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This orange French toast bake is a fresh twist on a breakfast classic that is bursting with subtle citrus flavor, a perfect recipe if you’re feeding a large group. You’re not standing at a stove frying French toast, and everything comes out of the oven, hot and ready to serve at once.</p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Triple Sec or other orange liqueur</li>
        <li>1/2 fresh orange, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon orange extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>12 slices cinnamon raisin bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar, or as needed (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons warm maple syrup, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease two large baking sheets or line with parchment paper, lightly sprayed with cooking spray, which will keep the bread from sticking.</li>
        <li>2. In a bowl, whisk eggs until light in color. Add milk, sugar, orange liqueur, orange juice, orange zest, orange extract, salt, and nutmeg, whisking until well combined.</li>
        <li>3. Coat bread slices in the egg custard, and place on the baking sheets without overlapping. Bake until golden brown, flipping halfway through baking time, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>4. To serve, sprinkle with confectioners sugar and drizzle with maple syrup.
